Software:
The software used for this project was Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook can be used by downloading and running the Anaconda3 Navigator to support it.

Project Description:
The basis of this project is to run 1 supervised and 1 unsupervised machine learning algorithm to solve a classification problem.
This data deals with predicting whether or not clients will default on their home equity line of credit.
The classification problem at hand is determining who will default or repay their debt.
The althernate issue is determining the rate at which to charge potential clients based on tiers or bins.
This would be especially helpful to a small community bank or credit union with a less automated process for selection.
